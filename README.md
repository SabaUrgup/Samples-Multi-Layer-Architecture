# Samples-Multi-Layer-Architecture
Basic Multi-Tier Architecture examples created by me using ASP.NET Core Web API &amp; C# with MySQL database technologies.

This repository contains samples of a multi-layered architecture in software development. It demonstrates the implementation of best practices for structuring applications, including separation of concerns, modularity, and scalability. The samples cover various aspects of the architecture, showcasing how data access, business logic, and user interface components are organized and interact within a multi-layered system. These examples serve as a valuable resource for understanding and applying sound architectural principles in software development projects.
